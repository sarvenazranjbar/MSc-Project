# MSc-Project
 My MSc project code files.



 Two files exist in this repo you should run each file seperately (you should run the 'main' files only).
 It is suggested that you use 'pycharm' to run the codes because it's easy to run and this app has been used to develop it.
 Atom folder shows atoms interaction and Natural selection shows evolution of living-like cells in 3 selections.

 When you run the Atoms folder you should see a window where atoms in different colours are randomely placed and they start to move and interact with each other.
 When you run the Natural selection a window opens where you can choose the type of selection you would like to see. By choosing an option you will see generation 0 of that specific selection by clicking the 'Next' button selection will apply to the society.

 If you need to run the code again you have to stop the project from the code (or close the window) and re-run the app.



The Atoms folder belongs to the atoms interaction section of the dissertation. The component includes all the atoms classes.
The colour guids are as follows:
Carbon - Blue
Oxygen - Red
Nitrogen - Yellow
Hydrogen - Green
Sulfur - Pink
Phosphorous - White

The Natural selection folder contains all the natural selection files. The colour guid is as follows:
Spatial elimination selection:
White - Normal cell
Red - Crossover positive
Green - Mutation Positive


Food selection:
Yellow - Food patricles
White - Normal cells
Red - Crossover positive
Green - Mutation positive


Disease selection:
White - Normal cells
Purple - Immune cell
Blue - Infected cells and the source of disease
